- COMPILING AND INSTALLING UNDER LINUX:
Usually, you just need to install libgimp2.0-dev package (this name is on Debian 
and other distros) to have the full set of libraries and dependences for compiling BIMP.
Then:

 make && make install

(don't mind the warnings...)


- INSTALLING UNDER WINDOWS:
BIMP plugin for Windows is already compiled and it's saved in bin/win32 directory.
Just copy bimp.exe into the default GIMP-plugins folder:
<Programs-dir>\<GIMP-folder>\lib\gimp\<version>\plug-ins

Documentation @ http://www.alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp


- COMPILING AND INSTALLING UNDER LINUX:
You need to install libgimp2.0-dev and libpcre3-dev packages 
to have the full set of libraries and dependences for compiling BIMP.
Then:

 make && make install

NOTE:
1) don't type 'sudo' before 'make install', otherwise "normal" users won't see the installed plugin
2) don't mind the warnings...


- INSTALLING UNDER WINDOWS:
BIMP plugin for Windows is already compiled and it's saved in bin/win32 directory.
Just copy bimp.exe and pcre3.dll files into the default GIMP-plugins folder:
<Programs-dir>\<GIMP-folder>\lib\gimp\<version>\plug-ins
